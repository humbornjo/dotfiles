## TODO
- [-] ~~From [fish](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell) to [nushell](https://github.com/nushell/nushell)~~
  because fish is super cool and nushell is not as productive as they said.
- [x] ~~Add [nnn](https://github.com/jarun/nnn) as terminal file-manager~~
- [x] learn how to [improve my workflow](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/w8n831/use_overseernvim_to_run_commands_on_save/) using dap and overseer.
- [ ] clean my config, time to be a epic lua developer, baby.
